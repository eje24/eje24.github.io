            <p>  I'm a senior at MIT studying computer science and mathematics. I'm interested in probabilistic/flow-based generative modeling, geometric deep learning, and applications to science. I also enjoy thinking about programming languages, operating systems, compilers, and anything in-between.  </p>

            <p> Previously, I have worked on trading infrastructure at <a href="https://drw.com">DRW</a>, on predicting binding affinity in protein-ligand docking at <a href='https://www.genesistherapeutics.ai'>Genesis Therapeutics</a>, and before that as a full stack engineering intern at <a href="https://www.findourview.com/">FindOurView</a>. </p>
            <p> I also like to dance, bike, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144083087-ezra-erives">read</a>, and
